Multi-Material test code: Full and sparse data structures

This code is a set of multi-material test kernels used on a random and geometric multi-material mesh to test the performance of different full and sparse data structures. It supports the paper "A Comparative Study of Multi-material Data Structures for Computational Physics Applications", Technical Report LA-UR-16-23889
